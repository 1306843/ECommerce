Need to implement session to keep a user logged in

Change the index.html, about-us.html navbar to show "logged in" nav options
  - Logged in options: Home, About Us, View Profile, Logout
  - Logged out options: Home, About Us, Register, Login

Implement log out functionality

profile.html:
  - display all user info (from database)
  - edit user info (edit the database too)
  - (additional function) Upload profile picture, save it to database

shop.html:
  - save user's subscription to database (another table userInformation)
        - store profile picture, subscription, coupons?
